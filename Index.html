                <h2>The Name Dracula</h2>
                <p>The name Dracula, before it was associated with the vampire in Bram Stoker's novel, was how people
                    refered to Vlad III. The name was no mere vanity, in Old Romanian, Dracula meant "Son of Dracul", or
                    "Son of the Dragon", because of his father, Vlad II Dracul.</p>
                <p>Vlad Dracul was the founder of the House of Drăculești, a branch of the noble house Basarab; Vlad
                    chose the name "Dracul", which means Dragon in medieval Romanian.</p>

                <h2>Who was Vlad III?</h2>
                <p>Vlad III, or Vlad the Impaler as he would later be known, was a Wallachian Voivode who ruled over his
                    country three times between 1448 and his death in 1476/77.</p>
                <p>Despite his fame as a ruthless and bloodthirsty fiend, Vlad III was a competent tactician and fair
                    ruler, and is still to this day regarded as a Romanian national hero.</p>
                <p>Vlad Tepeș (or "Impaler"), as he is known in Romanian, is credited for keeping the advances of the
                    Ottoman Empire in
                    Europe at bay, having he himself engaged in a bloody conflict with the then Ottoman Sultan, Mehmed
                    II, with whom Vlad had grown up since a very young age.</p>

                <h2>Why "The Imapler"?</h2>
                <p>Not one ruler may claim they were not responsible for deaths in their territories, especially so
                    during the 15th century; nearly every monarch, aristocrat or member of the clergy was credited with
                    taking lives, directly or indirectly, of enemies or citizens. Why is that then that some of them are
                    still remembered centuries later for such acts, while most others are seen as just and wise? It
                    could be merely because those who history treats as heroes are actually the ones who wrote the
                    books, but there are more reasons. One is forever remembered as a killer and monster if the way they
                    conducted their massacres was particularly gruesome, or if the sheer number of victims is off the
                    charts for the time. In the specific case of Vlad III, it is all of the above.</p>
                <p>Vlad the Impaler acquired this bloody sobriquet because of his preferred method of disposing of his
                    enemies. It was not simply a way to take out a foe, but a
                    warning to all others who would dare get in his way.</p>
                <p>Imaplement is a horrific practice, process which unfortunately is still very much
                    remembered in graphic detail in the 21st century, of which you, dear reader, will be spared, in
                    order to keep the contents of your stomach in place.</p>
