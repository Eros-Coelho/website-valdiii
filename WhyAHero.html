                <h2>Why Would Dracula be Anyone's Hero?</h2>
                <p>Well, for starters, I do not condole neither murder nor cruelty, and I understand why picking Dracula
                    as a
                    personal hero would be seen as odd by most. We must remember that history is written by the winners,
                    and although Vlad
                    III was very successful in the majority of his endeavours, he did not ultimately "win"; that honour
                    fell with Sultan
                    Mehmed II, or Mehmed the Conqueror.</p>
                <p>What I personally admire about Vlad Dracula is his tactical brilliance, how he managed to accomplish
                    so much in the face of so much adversity. Being given as a hostage by his own father, growing up in
                    a hostile environment, then assuming rulership of a small country, but forever at war with his more
                    powerful neighbours, and even though maintaining a ruthless streak of victories, that is, until the
                    bitter end.</p>

                <h2>Vlad III of Wallachia, the Historical Figure</h2>
                <p>I am a great fan of history in general, and even more so when it comes to European Middle Ages. Since
                    I moved here, I have met so many people from Eastern Europe, which drew my curiosity with their
                    culture, history and languages; that was what made me watch the Netflix documentary "Rise of
                    Empires: Ottomans". I already knew of Vlad's story, but searching about it is weirdly inspiring and
                    entertaining, and for a time was my favourite past time.</p>

            <section id="vlad-vampire">
                <h2>Dracula, the Vampire</h2>
                <p>While the character Count Dracula of Transylvania would not exactly be a "perosnal hero", it is by
                    far one of my favourite fictional characters, especially his depiction on my favourite game, Vampire
                    the Masquerade.</p>
                <p>The vampire Dracula in this game is much like Vlad III, but maybe more ruthless if taken into account
                    the setting for the story. He belongs to a vampire clan called the "Tzimisce", ancient feudal lords
                    of Eastern Europe, and more specifically Transylvania and the surrounding Carpathians.</p>
                <p>Although Dracula does belong to their bloodline, he has no love for those monsters who, in this
                    story, were the true culprits of murdering his father and older brother, as well as conspiring
                    against him to steal the throne of Wallachia. He is an independent thinker, who wants nothing to do
                    with the petty politics of the vampires, and so went into isolation.</p>
                <p>During modern nights, Dracula got tired of the folly of man and the limitless ambitions of vampires;
                    he longs for the days of old, when the affairs of men and monsters were governed by birthright,
                    honour and bloodshed, but he knows these days will never come back. Now, he simply sits on his
                    lonely throne and waits.</p>
