                <h2>The Story That Begins with the Father</h2>
                <p>Vlad III had a rather difficult childhood. While it does not excuse his actions, it certainly
                    explains them, and there are historians in the 21st century who believe Dracula was merely a
                    politician, not a monster or madman.</p>
                <p>Vlad III was the second legitimate son of the then ruler of Wallachia, Vlad II Dracul, who was
                    himself the illegitimate son of Mircea I of Wallachia. Vlad II was caught between two great rival
                    nations, the Ottoman Empire to the south and east, and Hungary to the north and west. Despite his
                    reputation as a fierce Christian crusader, the Hungarian warlord John Hunyadi did not extend his aid
                    to Vlad, preferring the replacement of the voivode with a more pliable man over fighting the Turks.
                </p>
                <p>In this precarious situation, Vlad II saw no alternative other than pledging his loyalty to the
                    Ottoman Sultan, Murad II.</p>

            <section id="deal">
                <h2>The Deal that Sealed Dracula's Life</h2>
                <p>During the years Vlad II Dracul supposedly served the Sultan, Murad II offered protection against the
                    Hungarians, though the Voivode was clever, and prevented Ottoman control over Wallachia as much as
                    he could.</p>
                <p>Eventually, however, the Sultan realised something was amiss, and summoned Vlad II Dracul to him,
                    along with his two elder sons, to pay homage and explain the situation. The Voivode suspected Murad
                    had caught on, and instead took his two younger sons, Vlad III and Radu III.</p>
                <p>In case Murad II decided to execute or imprison him and his sons, Vlad's elder son, Mircea, was in
                    position to assume rulership of Wallachia. His worst fears came true when Murad accused him of
                    conspiring against his allies, and threatened to kill him. As a last resort, Vlad II pledge his sons
                    to the Ottomans, to be under the Sultan's care, and as colateral for the prince's actions.
                    Basically, Vlad II offered his two sons as hostages to one of the most powerful leaders in the
                    world, and whom he already planned to betray.</p>

                <h2>Children Hostage</h2>
                <p>Now formally given to the Ottoman Sultan, Vlad III and his brother Radu, also known as Radu the
                    Handsome, were prisoners of the Ottomans. They were raised in Murad II's court, alongside with the
                    Sultan's own son, Mehmed II, also known as Mehmed the Conqueror.</p>
                <p>Vlad endured his captivity differently than his younger brother Radu, preferring to study warfare,
                    philosophy, and train in sword fighting and riding, while Radu would convert to the Turkish way of
                    life, and become an active member in the Sultan's court in the future.</p>
                <p>Contrary to what their father thought, netiher Vlad nor Radu were butchered by the Ottomans, even
                    when Vlad II Dracul supported a Christian Crusade against the Sultan. After the assassination of
                    Vlad II Dracul and his eldest son Mircea, Vladislav II (son of Vlad II Dracul's cousin, Dan II) was
                    placed ion the Wallachian throne by John
                    Hunyadi, who by then had become Regent of Hungary, and fierce opposition to the House of Drăculești.
