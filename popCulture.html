                <h2>Dracula, by Bram Stoker</h2>

                    alt="cover of the original edition of Dracula by Bram Stoker">
                <p>Dracula, by Bram Stoker was published in 1897, and it isn't clear, and sometimes even flat out
                    contradicted, that the vampire Dracula was based on Vlad III; supposedly, the novelist simply took
                    the name and "loose information about him", and there were alledgedly no mentions of the voivode in
                    Stoker's notes for the book. Regardless, the two bloodthirsty figures have been associated for over
                    a hundred years, to the point it would be hard to convince the public they are unrelated.</p>
                <p>Before Stoker's novel, vampires were seen as peasant superstition, but thanks to Dracula, the legends
                    of the bloodsucking fiends of the night became a topic of popular culture, which in a way turned
                    people more sceptic, abandoning (in part) superstition and myth, as the world proceded to the 20th
                    century.</p>

                <h2>Dracula in Vampire: The Masquerade</h2>
                <img src="./images/dracula-vtm.webp" alt="illustration of the vampire dracula">
                <p>Not the first, but surely my favourite depiction of Dracula as a vampire is in the Table Top
                    Roleplaying Game Vampire: The Masquerade; in this fictional universe, Vlad Dracula was not the first
                    nor the most powerful of vampires, though old and powerful he was, but certainly the most famous
                    one.</p>
                <p>This TTRPG tries to follow its lore with history adjacent characters and events, and it would not be
                    different with the most known vampiric figure in the world. Vlad Dracula, since his birth, was the
                    subject of a powerful prophecy, saying he would have unmatched influence over vampires in the
                    future, so the fiends of Transylvania dealt with him with caution. In time, he became their enemy,
                    actively seeking them out and destroying them, until they had enough and set out to kill the Impaler
                    Prince, but instead walked into the voivode's trap. Dracula captured two ancient vampires of the
                    entourage sent to end him, and forced one of them to turn him, then consumed the other. To his sire
                    (how they refer to the vampire who turned another), he freed with the admionition to never challenge
                    him again.</p>
                <p>Interestingly enough, the novel entitled "Dracula" was Vlad III's doing. As a means to be left alone
                    by the opposing vampire factions who secretly run the world, Dracula disguise himself as Ármin
                    Vámbéry, manipulated the Irish writer Stoker, telling stories of his life and homeland, and playing
                    on
                    people's superstitions of vampires. The result was the whole world knowning his story, and every man
                    turning into a sceptic at the mere suggestion of Dracula or vampires.</p>
                <p>After this incredible event for the vampire world, Dracula went into seclusion. In the centuries
                    since, Vlad Dracula holds a lonely court, and in modern nights has been looking to attain a state in
                    vampirism called "Golconda", where the afflictions commonly associated with vampires will no longer
                    hinder his existence.</p>
